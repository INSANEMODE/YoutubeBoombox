I am sorry about the compression.

How to use:
1. Obtain boombox
2. Left click while holding boombox
3. Paste URL
4. Click play
5. Wait a few seconds for everyone to download
6. Profit.

Features:
- Play music from youtube and sync to all clients as long as everyone has the mod
- Client side boombox volume control
  - Hold a boombox and type `/bbv number` to change the volume of that boombox on your client
    - Example: `/bbv 50` is half as loud
- Supports basic `youtube.com/watch` links and shortened `youtu.be` links
- Supports playlist links like `youtube.com/playlist?list=LIST_ID` ensure there's no `v=` in there, otherwise it'll play just the single video
- Retains downloads until you restart the game, meaning playing the same songs in the same session only needs to download once, making repeats faster

TODO:
- Add a config option to keep the boombox on while in your inventory.
- Better UI.
- Allow the mod to be used in lobbies where not everyone has the mod by only waiting on the number of people with the mod.
  - Currently if you use the mod in a lobby and not everyone has it, it will wait forever.
- Playlist support.
