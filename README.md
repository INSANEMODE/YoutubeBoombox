I am sorry about the compression.

How to use (make sure you're on 1.0.3+, earlier versions of the mod had issues):
1. Obtain boombox
2. Left click while holding boombox
3. Paste URL
4. Click play
5. Wait a few seconds for everyone to download
6. Profit.

TODO:
- Reuse already downloaded files if played again in the same session.
  - Files are already deleted when you restart the game.
- Add a config option to keep the boombox on while in your inventory.
- Better UI.
- Volume adjustment.
